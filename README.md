be-prepared is a Jekyll theme for Scout group websites based on the UK Scout Association's brand guidelines.

I created this theme as part of a project to upgrade [newlongtonscouts.com](https://newlongtonscouts.com) to run on Jekyll and GitHub pages in an effort to make the site cheaper to run, easier to edit, prettier and more responsive. When I'd finished, I was impressed by how the site looked and functioned compared to other Scout sites I'd see, so I converted it into a Jekyll theme and made it publicly available in the hope it may help other volunteers who also want websites for their groups.

This template project is a quick and easy way to produce your very own Scout group website. Get started by reading the docs [here](https://github.com/newlongtonscouts/be-prepared-template/wiki).

**WARNING!** - this theme was initially made for a specific site, so it does have a few quirks (weird CSS class names etc). This is just a by-product of how the theme came to be. You can always extend the CSS as described in the docs. You could even add some contributions yourself - I'd be glad to see the the theme succeed.
